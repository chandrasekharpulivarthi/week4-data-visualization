Customer & Sales Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales performance and customer churn using Python.
The objective is to understand customer purchasing behavior, identify sales trends, and analyze customer churn through data visualization and reporting.

The project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow including data loading, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and report generation.

Objectives

* Analyze sales data to calculate total revenue
* Identify top-performing product categories
* Study monthly sales trends
* Analyze customer churn behavior
* Create visualizations for better insight
* Generate a professional PDF report with embedded charts

Dataset Description

The project uses the following datasets:

* **sales_data.csv** – Contains sales transactions, quantities, prices, and product categories
* **customer_churn.csv** – Contains customer churn information


Tools and Technologies

* Python
* Pandas (Data Manipulation)
* Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
* FPDF (PDF Report Generation)
* Google Colab

Analysis and Visualizations

The following analyses were performed:

* Total sales calculation
* Product category-wise sales analysis (Bar Chart)
* Monthly sales trend analysis (Line Chart)
* Customer churn distribution analysis (Pie Chart)

All visualizations are embedded in the final report.

How to Run the Project

1. Open Google Colab
2. Upload the file `customer_analysis.ipynb`
3. Upload the required CSV files:

   * `sales_data.csv`
